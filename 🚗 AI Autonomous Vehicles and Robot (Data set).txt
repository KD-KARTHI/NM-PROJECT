🚗 AI Autonomous Vehicles and Robotics Project Overview
📌 Project Title: "Autonomous Lane and Obstacle Detection Robot using Computer Vision"
🧠 Project Components
✅ 1. Source Code (Python with OpenCV + optionally ROS)
Features:

Lane detection using image processing and/or deep learning (CNN)

Obstacle detection using object detection (YOLOv5/YOLOv8 or Haar Cascades)

Motor control logic (for simulated or Raspberry Pi-based robot)

Optional: ROS (Robot Operating System) support

✅ PROJECT REQUIREMENTS
🔧 1. Software Requirements
✅ Programming Languages
Python 3.7 or later

✅ Libraries & Frameworks
Library	Purpose
OpenCV	Image processing & computer vision
NumPy	Numerical operations
Matplotlib	Visualization
PyTorch / TensorFlow	Deep learning (if using neural networks)
Ultralytics YOLOv5	Object detection (YOLO pre-trained models)
scikit-learn	Optional: evaluation, preprocessing

✅ Tools (Optional but Recommended)
Jupyter Notebook – For prototyping

Anaconda – For environment management

Roboflow – For dataset preparation or augmentation

Google Colab – Free GPU for training and testing models

🧠 2. Hardware Requirements (if using real robotics platform)
For Simulated Project
A PC or laptop with:

RAM: 8 GB or higher

GPU: NVIDIA GPU with CUDA (optional but preferred for deep learning)

Storage: 10–20 GB for datasets and model weights

For Physical Robot (optional extension)
Raspberry Pi 4 or NVIDIA Jetson Nano

Pi Camera or USB webcam

Ultrasonic sensors or LiDAR (for obstacle detection)

Motor Driver (e.g., L298N)

Chassis with wheels

Power bank or battery

📂 3. Dataset Requirements
Use any of the following:

TuSimple for lane detection

nuScenes or COCO for object detection

Roboflow Lane Dataset

📤 4. Output Requirements
Lane overlay images (showing detected lanes)

Object bounding boxes (showing detected vehicles/obstacles)

Logs or real-time stats (e.g., speed, object distance, lane deviation)

📄 5. Documentation Requirements
README.md file with:

Project overview

Installation instructions

How to run the code

Dataset download links

Sample output screenshots

Report or Presentation (optional) including:

Architecture diagram

Dataset description

Results (accuracy, precision, recall, etc.)


✅ 2. Dataset
Public datasets for lane detection or object detection.

If training custom models is too complex, we can use pretrained ones.

✅ 3. Output Images
Lane detection results (curves, overlays)

Object detection bounding boxes
